# Transil

Declarative IL generation for Harmony transpilers
---
Automate Harmony patches with annotation-driven IL hijacking. Define handler methods with `[ILHijackHandler]` attributes to:
- Auto-generate replacement IL instructions
- Inject arguments and access members via attributes
- Seamlessly integrate with CodeMatcher for precise targeting

Ideal for complex Harmony patches requiring dynamic code generation.
